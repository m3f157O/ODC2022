each new art is a struct pointing to 2 structs



toh art is in RODATA which can be LEAKED





no double free, no use after free




rename art is broken, no check on new art size ;)))))

but first need to leak heap address, to bypass sigsegv, but to read it need to increase print size 
so its not exploitable :((((
  

^^ this is false as we can move the main data structure in place of that in position 0



need posion null byte for leak,
tcache exploitation is easy then


leak executed

align with free hok and call free on chunk containing bin sh

jmp to 512 must be 8
